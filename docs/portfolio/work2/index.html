         <h1>Gardenio App</h1>
         <p>Design a mobile app which empowers users to learn more about food growing, creates a community and a thriving marketplace all in one.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Gardenio&rsquo;s mission is to empower people to grow their own food and use that medium for people to reconnect with themselves, their neighbors and a larger community. The overarching goal that the client Gardenio provided us was to design a mobile app which empowers users to learn more about food growing, creates a community and a thriving marketplace all in one.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="client-kickoff">Client Kickoff</h2>
<p>During the kickoff meeting, I learnt that our client had a strong belief that the company&rsquo;s growth will be powered by a strong and thriving community of food growers on their platform. The current communities mostly leverage facebook or google groups and are very fragmented in nature.</p>
<p>Being a part of a community unlocks the social experience where individuals feel more confident by the resources and guidance they recieve from other members. As they move along in this journey, they themselves can start to contribute back in educating and mentoring members who are just getting started.</p>

<h2 id="business-model-canvas">Business Model Canvas</h2>
<p>To understand how Gradenio as an organization creates and delivers value to its customers, I mapped out various elements to communicate details of Gardenio&rsquo;s business model and potential revenue streams.</p>
<p>Continuing on the value propositions provided by the customer about &ldquo;Empowering users&rdquo; and &ldquo;Building a community&rdquo;, various activites were idenitified which can realize these objectives. These activities were then tied to various revenue streams they naturally unlock.</p>

<h2 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h2>
<p>Based on user interviews, I found that they are really interested in learning about the best ways to take care of the plants they own. This starts from getting this information to them at the time of purchase to help them make informed decisions about what they are buying. It also encourages them to subscribe for care-packages (e.g. fertilizers) suitable for the specific plants they own.</p>
<p>They also like to seek advice from experts when they run into issues with their plants or simply need guidance in planning their garden based on needs, environment and budget.</p>
<p>Together these user scenarios were mapped into a user flow which eventually informed the high fidelity designs for app screens.</p>

<h2 id="design-details-and-notification">Design: Details and Notification</h2>
<p>Plant care and education was the core feature requested by the users during our interviews. Hence the plant purchase page was designed with a central focus around this theme. Users are made aware of the basic details about the plants and care instructions right when they are considering a purchase. Based on geographical location of the user it will inform which plants can be easily grown there.</p>
<p>The app also supports keeping a list of plants that they own (like a virtual garden) and enables the users to set custom notifications, reminding them about watering and other activities to take good care of their plants. This has been the most common concern which people mentioned during our interviews that people forget to timely water plants, add fertilizer and/or trim them which affects its health.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/gardenio/Slide4.png" alt="Design: Details and Notification" title="Design: Details and Notification"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="design-blog">Design: Blog</h2>
<p>Feature to add blogs in the app from various users to retain user engagement. People can search for topic of interest from the variety of blogs by using key search words or hashtags. There are various blogs around DIY projects. Users can give ratings or write reviews based on how they found the blog.</p>
<p>It is essential for every business to generate revenue, so thus there is a feature where anytime a user finds a DIY blog interesting, they can shop for related products within the app without going anywhere else.</p>

<h2 id="design-expert-chat">Design: Expert Chat</h2>
<p>People want to grow plants. It not onloy gives them happiness but also motivates organic food. But there is big learning curve to growing plants which comes with experience. To help new plant growers, there is an option to chat with experts when a plant grower notices something isn&rsquo;t going well with the plant. They can share image of affected area in plant and can get feedback on it. Experts can be anyone, they can be professionals or people in neighborhood. It has also helps with community building where people can meet and discuss about their plants.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/gardenio/Slide6.png" alt="Design: Expert Chat" title="Design: Expert Chat"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="design-payment">Design: Payment</h2>
<p>Easy checkout button to facilitate quick buying, alongwith an add-on button of other things which are needed for growing plants. It not only helps users to ensure they have everything available but also a nice way to generate additional revenue to business. There is also a feature to subscribe and save which can generate recurring revenue to business.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/gardenio/Slide7.png" alt="Design: Payment" title="Design: Payment"></p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p>Apart from these, there can be other few ways too to generate revenues and gain popularity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of relying on users to buy plants from website, gifting of plants can be promoted. People love to give plants compared to giving flowers as they feel it will be something which stays with people for a very long time.</li>
<li>To generate additional revenue, related sponsored ads can be shown like DIY projects, beautiful vases etc. for extra earnings alongwith making it useful for users</li>
<li>Instead of only relying on nurseries for plants, local households can be contacted too for plant supplies. It will not only reduce cost but will also build community where people can buy and exchange from household people. Another advantage is it will reduce complete dependency on nurseries.</li>
<li>Everyone loves discounts and promotions. Initial discount will excite people which will help gain attention and popularity.</li>
