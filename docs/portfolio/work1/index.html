         <h1> ESTABLISHING TRUST IN INDEED USERS</h1>
         <p>To identify design and architectural elements that create or withhold the feeling of trust of a user towards indeed.com</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Indeed’s UX research Director has shown some concerns that users have used indeed&rsquo;s portal frequently to search for job openings but they don’t actually apply through it. His assumption is that users probably don&rsquo;t trust indeed&rsquo;s portal that much. Hence, he asked us to identify key elements which indeed can implement to enhance trust among its users. They also want to capture the untapped mobile job market and hence wanted us to look at mobile as the primary medium of interaction.</p>

<p><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE</strong></p>
<p>For our target audience, we decided to focus on people who held a diploma or a degree. This was because indeed wanted us to focus on their mobile application, and we wanted a target population who are comfortable and had prior experience in applying for jobs through their phones.</p>
<p><strong>RESEARCH FOCUS AREAS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>UPLOADING RESUME FEATURE</strong>: Our research focus was how we can enable/enrich user experience so that users can easily create and upload resumes through mobile phones. We also wanted to explore the limitations which users are having currently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>INDEED&rsquo;S APPLY FEATURE</strong>:Our research focus was how can we overcome design and psychological barriers which is not letting users apply through indeed’s apply feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MOBILE EXPERIENCE</strong>: Our research focus was to understand how to improvise current mobile experience of users as indeed wants to capture the untapped mobile job market.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review">LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/indeed/3pillars.png" alt="LITERATURE REVIEW" title="LITERATURE REVIEW"></p>
<p><strong>SLASH GENERATION</strong></p>
<p>The Slash Generation is made up of adults roughly ages 21-35 that are relatively fresh faces in the workforce. The term “Slash Generation” comes from the uncommon combination of job titles they prefer to take on at one time. For e.g. UX researcher/ UI designer/ Interaction designer, Software engineer/Data Scientist/Machine learning engineer. In order to increase chances of getting job, users apply to multiple roles rather than being stuck to one particular role.</p>
<p><strong>MOBILE USED AS PRIMARY DEVICE</strong></p>
<p>Our research showed that around 78% of US job applicants will prefer to apply through mobile if they are given a chance. On average, every household in the US has 3 devices: laptop, mobile phone and tablet.</p>

<h2 id="heuristic-evaluation">HEURISTIC EVALUATION</h2>
<p><strong>VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When users apply to companies recommended by the system, they are clueless after submitting their job application and resume at indeed website. It deeply affects users as they are unsure whether the application has reached the prospective company or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An option to create indeed account showed at the beginning while exploring the website initially. Even after constantly clicking the cross button associated with it, the end message was that ”Your account has been created”. User didn’t have the option to modify and isn’t even aware of what information and how it has been added. The user didn’t have the intention to create an account that time but still the account got created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While trying to upload a resume under the assumption that it will speeden the application process of applying online, it showed an error that the resume cannot be uploaded and a notification that some error has occurred. Despite many attempts it kept showing that some error had occurred but the user had no clue what kind of error it was and how to fix that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>HELP AND DOCUMENTATION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A help center is placed in the footer to find errors and other document details. A search bar which is one of the most important elements in any website is missing. A user cannot search quickly for something which they are looking for as they are unable to locate that such crucial information will be in footer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The page is overloaded with content. It needs to be simplified so users can use them easily. A huge amount of information is shown which makes users confused and overwhelmed. They should also be given an option of easy sorting along with filters so they can use the website in their desired way. Currently sorting is restricted to date and provides No. other way to sort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Website is not consistent for all job postings. For some, it only gives the option to apply directly at the company&rsquo;s website, some places they can apply through indeed website and at some places they don’t have any link for applying. A consistent way will be helpful as users will know which method they should follow instead of being confused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ERROR PREVENTION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Website many times shows expired job postings to users. When a user tries to apply for the particular posting, finds that it is expired and cannot apply for it now.</p>

<h2 id="competitive-evaluation">COMPETITIVE EVALUATION</h2>
<p>We assessed the strengths and weaknesses of current direct and indirect competitors. This analysis provided us with context to identify the prevalent practices and opportunity areas for indeed to target.</p>
<p>We evaluated 3 competitors of indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn and Google search and found they all have their own niche markets which indeed lacks currently. Glassdoor has its speciality for reviews and salary information, LinkedIn has its speciality for networking and Google has an amazing search engine but indeed offers all 3 of these but lacks in carving its niche in anything particular.</p>

<h2 id="interviews">INTERVIEWS</h2>
<p>To dive deeper and measure an objective reality that exists externally from the researcher, we conducted qualitative research with my classmates. Although expensive, interviews are great way to uncover the WHYs and HOWs behind users actions. It helped us find out what drives people to behave in a certain way.</p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/indeed/interviewee.png" alt="INTERVIEWS" title="INTERVIEWS"></p>
<p><strong>Interview Findings</strong></p>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/indeed/findings.png" alt="INTERVIEWS" title="INTERVIEWS"></p>
<p>We mapped our interview findings and extracted theme into 3 pillars (Content, Design, Security) model.</p>
<p>We found out that “Transparency” is the fourth factor of the trust metrics.</p>
<p>Participant 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don’t know if the HR sees my resume from Indeed’s website and it makes me nervous. That‘s why I always apply through the company’s website because I think I would have a higher chance to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, security might not be as important as we thought for a job searching platform. People are okay with giving away some of their personal information to get a job.</p>
<p>Participant 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I start receiving more spam email after I post my resume on job boards. I think it’s a trade-off for finding a job.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="usability-testing">USABILITY TESTING</h2>
<p>We asked 4 participants to apply on the desktop and the other 4 participants to apply on mobile. They were asked to try 3 websites (Indeed, LinkedIn and Glassdoor) and share there experience while using it.</p>
<p>Different websites obtained the following usability scores:</p>

<h2 id="surveys">SURVEYS</h2>
<p>After our user interviews, we wanted to know how pervasive was the problem of job applications and search is in the actual job market. So we conducted surveys with real participants. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk for recruiting participants and Qualtrics for designing surveys. We got 285 responses in total. Our target demographic was a degree/diploma holder residing in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Survey Findings:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>People preferred the laptop/desktop for all the stages of the application process including creating resumes/cover letters, , searching for jobs, networking, applying for jobs etc</li>
<li>The mobile phone was a close second in job search and networking</li>
<li>Indeed was the most used application for job applications.</li>
</ol>
