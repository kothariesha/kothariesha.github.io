         <h1>Steve.AI</h1>
         <p>Steve.ai is an AI-based chatbot that helps people in switching their career. Our aim is to empower users with a tool that encourgaes them to explore a career of their choice.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Switching careers is hard but being stuck in a career which isn’t rewarding is harder. Our aim is to help people transition from one career to another smoothly and efficiently. Using user-centered design methodology, we designed a mobile application which uses advanced AI technology for helping people throughout the career switch process.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>People want to switch and transition to a career in the technology field especially because of relatively higher pay and number of job openings. People also find it exciting that skills are valued greatly even if a candidate doesn’t have a college degree. But, switching careers is hard.</p>
<p>The process of switching careers is extremely stressful and challenging. Most of the career switch paths are associated with going to college or taking courses online. But they both have their own challenges, going to college is expensive and there are an infinte number of courses available online making it very hard to find the relevant ones. This encouraged us to solve this problem which is affecting so many people.</p>

<h4 id="how-might-we-use-ai-technology-to-assist-people-to-during-their-career-switch-process">How might we use AI technology to assist people to during their career switch process?</h4>
<hr>
<p>We define our scope and the user tasks to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting a career switch goal</li>
<li>Researching about it</li>
<li>Networking with people</li>
<li>Selecting skills</li>
<li>Developing the skills</li>
</ul>
<p>and the next steps potentially will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply for job</li>
<li>Prepare for interview</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-research">User Research</h2>
<h4 id="user-interview">User Interview</h4>
<p>We interviewed 7 people, 5 who are planning to switch careers and understand their pain points and 2 HR to find out what they look for in a candidate who is applying for a job.</p>

<h4 id="journey-map-co-creation">Journey Map Co-Creation</h4>
<p>We asked our interviewees to map their journey for us to understand their highs and lows during this process. Everyone had a common feeling that “developing skills” is the most difficult phase.</p>

<h2 id="problem-reformulation">Problem Reformulation</h2>
<p>Based on the insights, we reformulated the original high-level problem statement into a more detailed problem area that we want to focus on:</p>

<h2 id="storyboard-and-wireframes">Storyboard and Wireframes</h2>
<p>We made this storyboard which includes various user scenarios to guide our wireframes and high fidelity designs. The storyboard highlights user challenges, their interactions with Steve.AI app, how they evolve as they use the app and finally how they get to success.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/steveai/hfd.png" alt="HFD" title="HFD"></p>
<h3 id="feature-breakdown">Feature Breakdown</h3>
<p>These are the details about each feature, accompanied by their supporting user quotes:</p>
<h3 id="login-via-linkedin">Login via Linkedin</h3>
<p>Users can use their LinkedIn account to login to so that Steve.ai can parse the work experience, interests and the connections in your network. This makes the sign up process very quick and Steve.ai system already knows a lot about the user as soon as they sign up. This kick starts the recommendations and personalization engine from get go.</p>
<p>User’s quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Setting up my profile for a new app can be annoying for the first time.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/steveai/login.png" alt="Login" title="Login"></p>
<h3 id="smart-reminder">Smart Reminder</h3>
<p>Several studies have shown that gentle reminders and nudges can lead to continuous engagement from learners. Furthermore, if these can be customized based on the timings that are better for each user (e.g. after work hours), it can enable a much improved user experience. Steve.ai learns from the habits and emotions of the user and send reminders and notifications accordingly.</p>
<p>User’s quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Sometimes I know I should learn and practice, but I just feel down and not in the mood to do them.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/steveai/reminder.png" alt="Reminder" title="Reminder"></p>
<h3 id="soft-skills-training">Soft Skills Training</h3>
<p>Our studies indicated that soft skills are equally important as the technical skills. Hence we designed interfaces which can train users on skills like short talks about professional topics, self introduction etc. The objective is to empower our users towards better communication and networking practices. Since this is an AI based system, Steve.ai also uses natural language and audio processing to analyze content and voice tone automatically and gives immediate feedback.</p>
<p>User’s quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I’m not prepared enough to speak in front of people so I practice by myself, but I need feedback.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/img/portfolio/steveai/soft_skills_training.png" alt="Training" title="Training"></p>
<h3 id="study-partner--steve-grad">Study Partner &amp; Steve Grad</h3>
<ul>
<li>A study partner is also a current Steve.ai user. They can see each person’s learning progress and go to events or discuss about side projects together. We want the users to be connected with fellow learners which keeps them motivated towards reaching their goals.</li>
<li>Steve grad is a professional mentor who has used Steve.ai before and has successfullly done a career switch. Users can ask them for advice, learn from their experience and also potentially do side projects with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users’ quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t know how to find a mentor.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Professionals are usually busy, they don’t reply to me.”</p>
