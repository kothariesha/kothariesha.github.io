## Overview

Our interviews with people who have visual impairments show clothes shopping is an important activity in their lives. Unfortunately, clothes shopping web sites remain largely inaccessible. We propose design recommendations to address online accessibility issues reported by visually impaired study participants and an implementation, which we call BrowseWithMe, to address these issues. BrowseWithMe employs artificial intelligence to automatically convert a product web page into a structured representation that enables a user to interactively ask the BrowseWithMe system what the user wants to learn about a product (e.g., What is the price? Can I see a magnified image of the pants?). This enables people to be active solicitors of the specific information they are seeking rather than passive listeners of unparsed information. Experiments demonstrate BrowseWithMe can make online clothes shopping more accessible and produce accurate image descriptions.
